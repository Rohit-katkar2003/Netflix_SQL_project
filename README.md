# Netflix Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of Netflix titles to gain insights into the platform's content. The analysis includes exploring the types of content, ratings, release years, top countries for content, longest movies, recently added content, content by specific directors and actors, TV shows with multiple seasons, content distribution across genres, and content categorization based on keywords in descriptions.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single SQL script (`netflix_analysis.sql`) that contains all the queries used for the analysis and this README file (`README.md`).

## Database and Table

The analysis is performed on a database named `Netflix_db` and a table named `netflix_titles`. The script assumes that this database and table already exist and are populated with Netflix data.
### üì¶ Dataset Overview
We begin by understanding the dataset with basic exploratory queries:

### üîç Data Preview
View all records from the table to understand the structure and attributes.

### üßÆ Total Records
Count the total number of entries in the dataset.

### üé¨ Types of Content
Identify distinct content types such as "Movie" and "TV Show".

### üé• Unique Directors
Count how many unique directors are present in the dataset.

### üåç Countries Represented
Find how many different countries are included.

### üìÖ Data Coverage
Check the time range of the data from the earliest to the most recent release year.

### ‚≠ê Movie Ratings
List all unique ratings and the number of times each rating appears.
