# Netflix Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of Netflix titles to gain insights into the platform's content. The analysis includes exploring the types of content, ratings, release years, top countries for content, longest movies, recently added content, content by specific directors and actors, TV shows with multiple seasons, content distribution across genres, and content categorization based on keywords in descriptions.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single SQL script (`netflix_analysis.sql`) that contains all the queries used for the analysis and this README file (`README.md`).

## Database and Table

The analysis is performed on a database named `Netflix_db` and a table named `netflix_titles`. The script assumes that this database and table already exist and are populated with Netflix data.
### üì¶ Dataset Overview
We begin by understanding the dataset with basic exploratory queries:

### üîç Data Preview
View all records from the table to understand the structure and attributes.

### üßÆ Total Records
Count the total number of entries in the dataset.

### üé¨ Types of Content
Identify distinct content types such as "Movie" and "TV Show".

### üé• Unique Directors
Count how many unique directors are present in the dataset.

### üåç Countries Represented
Find how many different countries are included.

### üìÖ Data Coverage
Check the time range of the data from the earliest to the most recent release year.

### ‚≠ê Movie Ratings
List all unique ratings and the number of times each rating appears.


## Queries Performed

The `netflix_analysis.sql` script includes the following queries:
#### creating database
```sql
USE Netflix_db;
```

#### Question: What does the raw data in the netflix_titles table look like?
```sql
-- Select all data from the netflix_titles table to inspect its contents.
SELECT * FROM netflix_titles;
```
#### Question: How many total content items (movies and TV shows) are in the dataset?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS [total records in data]
FROM netflix_titles;
```
#### Question: What are the different types of content available on Netflix according to this data?
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT type
FROM netflix_titles;
```
#### Question: How many unique directors have content listed in this dataset?
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(director) AS [total directors in data]
FROM netflix_titles;
```

#### Question: From how many different countries does the content in this dataset originate?

#### Question: What is the earliest and latest year of content release represented in this data?
```sql
SELECT MIN(release_year) AS [starting year],
       MAX(release_year) AS [ending year]
FROM netflix_titles;
```
#### Question: What are the different content ratings present in the data, and how many items have each rating?
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT rating, COUNT(rating) AS [count rating]
FROM netflix_titles
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY [count rating] DESC;
```

## Solving business problems

#### Question 1: How many movies and how many TV shows are there in the dataset?
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT type,
       COUNT(type) AS [counts of type]
FROM netflix_titles
GROUP BY type;
```

#### Question 2: For both movies and TV shows, what are the top 3 most frequent content ratings?
```sql
SELECT type, rating
FROM (SELECT type,
             rating,
             COUNT(rating) AS [count of ratings],
             DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS ranking
      FROM netflix_titles
      GROUP BY type, rating) AS t1
WHERE ranking <= 3;
```

#### Question 3: Can you list all the movies that were released in the year 2020?
```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix_titles
WHERE type = 'Movie'
  AND release_year = 2020;
```

#### Question 4: Which are the top 5 countries that have contributed the most content (movies and TV shows) to Netflix?
```sql
SELECT TOP 5
       TRIM(new_country.value) AS country,
       COUNT(show_id) AS country_count
FROM netflix_titles
CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(country, ',') AS new_country
GROUP BY new_country.value
ORDER BY country_count DESC;
```

#### Question 5: What are the titles and durations of movies that are longer than 300 minutes?
```sql
SELECT title, duration, new_duration.value AS [minutes]
FROM netflix_titles
CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(duration, ' ') AS new_duration
WHERE type = 'Movie'
  AND ISNUMERIC(new_duration.value) = 1
  AND CAST(new_duration.value AS INT) > 300;
```

#### Question 6: How many movies and TV shows have been added to Netflix in the last 5 years?
```sql
